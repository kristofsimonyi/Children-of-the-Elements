101:
Inori loved nights. In the cool dark, tiny frogs hopped towards the house, the scent of humid sand drifted in the air. The kettle bubbled above the fire and the sea rippled outside. He was laying in his hammock, while Father’s muttering and the embers’ soft crackle rocked him to sleep. He knew Father was praying for luck, good wind, and a big catch. Fish meant life, and the rumble of the sea was its sound, its heartbeat and ceaseless sign.

103:
When Inori woke in the mornings, Father was already out to sea. Inori would run to the beach with rice pies in his pocket to greet the fishermen’s return. These early morning hours were the most magnificent of the day: waiting, the cold sand beneath his feet. Even when the ships were far from the shore, Inori knew how the fishing had gone that day. He saw the boat laden under the weight of the catch, the bent backs of the fishermen and the faint songs from the boat that the wind washed up, onto the beach. And he also saw it in the way his father waved. By the time they reached the shore, he already knew if the sea had been generous that day.

If the catch was nice, the fishermen packed it joyfully. Fish would lay in big baskets in the market, and men gathered to celebrate the day’s luck. Then, Inori often went to swim with Father. They found great pleasure in the living world of the sea, which reflected a rainbow of colors. Often the sea would speak to him. Sometimes, it babbled about remote salt-scented lands, or about the marvelous world between rolling seaweed hills. Now and then it moaned about dark storms.
Later, they sat on the coast and patched up the fishnet. Inori was proud he could help Father with that. He sewed beautifully.

And then one day, everything changed.

107:
On that day, Inori was standing on the coast, as he usually did, but the ships were late. When they finally came into sight, something tore at his heart. They were eerily quiet; the wind carried no sound or call of greeting from the boat, the faces of his father and the fishermen were solemn. That day, there was no market, and no fish either. 
Men gathered to share a strange silence while patching up the fishnets. Inori joined Father - the net was full of enormous holes as if something had ripped it apart. Repairing the net was long and tedious work. The worst part was that Father did not speak a word. They sat silently beside the net, late into the night, and Inori could not fall asleep easily.

The next day was quiet, and the day after too. Fishermen returned every morning with grave faces, ripped nets, and no fish. The only sounds were the rumble of the sea and the clacking of his father’s beads at dawn.

On Saturday the fishermen gathered for a discussion. They sat around Mother’s big bowl of shabu-shabu, dipping their chopsticks into the hot liquid. This untied their anxious knots. Inori nuzzled close to his dad, cheerfully drawing in the smell of hope and serenity. Finally, he learned the cause of the ripped nets and silent fishermen.

Giant jellyfish had arrived in the bays, creatures never seen before. They were so enormous and heavy that the nets couldn’t be pulled back with them inside. The fish either died or escaped their stings. The fishermen were powerless to stop the jellyfish from tearing the nets apart - yet there were so many, they couldn’t avoid them. If this continued, their families would starve.
As they cleaned the last drops of the soup from the bowl, the fishermen fell silent again. Even the oldest could only suggest they prepare themselves for scarcity.
