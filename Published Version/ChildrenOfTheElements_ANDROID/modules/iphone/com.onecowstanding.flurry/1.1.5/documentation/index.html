<h1>Flurry Module</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Module for integrating with the <a href="http://www.flurry.com/">Flurry</a> event tracking service. This module supports both the
iOS and Android Flurry SDKs. You need a Flurry account and application apiKey(s) to use this module.</p>
<p>The Flurry iOS and Android SDKs are not 100% feature equivalent. Where there are methods/properties in each SDK that
perform a common function, this module presents a normalized method/property name. If you only use these normalized
methods, then you will not need to have platform-specific code in your application (other than configuring a different
apiKey for the iOS and Android versions of your app). If you choose to use a method that is only supported on one
platform or the other, you may safely call these methods without having to wrap them in an application-specific block.
The method will simply do nothing if it is not supported on a particular platform. See the documentation details for a
breakdown of each method/property. Many methods/properties have aliases that come from corresponding name differences
in the Flurry iOS and Android SDKs. Either the primary property name or its alias can be used in the JavasScript for
your app, regardless of platform.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Add the following to the modules section in <code>tiapp.xml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;modules&gt;
    . . .
    &lt;module platform="android" version="1.1.5"&gt;com.onecowstanding.flurry&lt;/module&gt;
    &lt;module platform="iphone" version="1.1.5"&gt;com.onecowstanding.flurry&lt;/module&gt;
    . . .
&lt;/modules&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Basic setup:</p>
<pre><code>var Flurry = require("com.onecowstanding.flurry");
// configure pre-session settings
Flurry.startSession('00000000000000000000');
// log user information and events
</code></pre>
<p>See app.js for more detailed examples.</p>
<h2>Pre-Session Configuration Properties</h2>
<p>These should be set prior to calling <code>startSession()</code>.</p>
<h3>(string) appVersion  (alias: versionName)</h3>
<p>(optional) Specifies a specific version of your application.</p>
<h3>(bool) reportLocation</h3>
<p>(Android only) Specifies whether Flurry should include location information within its reports. Defaults to true.</p>
<h3>(bool) showErrorInLogEnabled</h3>
<p>(iOS only) Enables/disables display of exceptions in the debug log if thrown during a session. Defaults to false.</p>
<h2>(bool) debugLogEnabled  (alias: logEnabled)</h2>
<p>Enables/disables additional debug logging. Defaults to false.</p>
<h2>(bool) eventLoggingEnabled  (alias: logEvents)</h2>
<p>Enables/disables whether events that are sent to Flurry are written to the log. Defaults to false.</p>
<h2>(string) logLevel</h2>
<p>Specifies the logging level. There are different valid values for Android and iOS (this is at the Flurry SDK level). Use
conditional logic in your application if you wish to set this value. The following are valid values for this setting:
  (Android) verbose, debug, info, warn, error, assert
  (iOS) none, criticalOnly, debug, all</p>
<h2>(int) sessionContinueSeconds</h2>
<p>Specifies the number of seconds before an additional <code>startSession()</code> call results in a new session. Calling
<code>startSession()</code> a second time within the time specified by this setting will result in the previous session being
continued. A call to <code>startSession()</code> after this amount of time has elapsed will result in a new session being created.
The minimum timeout for a session is 5 seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.</p>
<h2>(int) continueSessionMillis</h2>
<p>This property configures the same setting as <code>sessionContinueSeconds</code>, however the value passed is specified in
milliseconds rather than seconds. On Android, you can use this method to configure a value with millisecond precision.
The Flurry SDK for iOS does not support this precision, so if you use this property on iOS and specify a value that is
not evenly divided by 1000, the property will be rounded to the nearest resulting second.</p>
<h3>(bool) secureTransportEnabled  (alias: useHttps)</h3>
<p>Specifies whether SSL should be used when calls are made to the Flurry API. Defaults to false.</p>
<h3>(bool) sessionReportsOnCloseEnabled</h3>
<p>(iOS only) Enables/disables reporting to Flurry when your app closes. This improves the speed at which analytics are
updated, however network latency can prolong the app termination process. In some cases, network latency can cause your
app to crash. Defaults to true.</p>
<h3>(bool) sessionReportsOnPauseEnabled</h3>
<p>(iOS only) Enables/disables reporting to Flurry when your app is paused (i.e. goes into the background). This improves
the speed at which analytics are updated, however network latency can prolong the app termination process. In some cases,
network latency can cause your app to crash. Defaults to false.</p>
<h3>(bool) backgroundSessionEnabled</h3>
<p>(iOS only) Enables/disables ending the Flurry session when your app goes into the background. When set to true, the Flurry
session remains active even when your app is in the background. This can be useful if your app does work in the background
that you want to track. Flurry documents this as suitable for music and radio apps. Defaults to false.</p>
<h3>(bool) crashReportingEnabled</h3>
<p>(iOS only) Enables/disables automatic collection and reporting of crash reports. Defaults to false.</p>
<h2>(bool) sessionReportsOnActivityChangeEnabled</h2>
<p>(Android only) Specifies whether or not the module should automatically monitor your app for Android lifecycle events and
trigger Flurry start/end session calls automatically when Android activities in your app are paused or resumed. If this
property is set to true, the first time startSession() is called the module will begin monitoring your app for Android
Activity changes (in Titanium, a different Android Activity is typically associated with each instance of a heavyweight
window). When the Android lifecycle 'onResume' event triggers on any activity monitored by the module, a startSession() call
is sent to Flurry. When the Android lifecycle 'onPause' event triggers on any activity monitored by the module, an
endSession() call is sent to Flurry. The module will attempt to listen for these lifecycle events on the activity that was
current when the first call to startSession() was made, as well as any additional activities that spawn from that activity.
Therefore, if you plan on using this feature, it is recommended that you initialize the module and make a call to
startSession() when your app first fires up (in app.js, for instance). If this property is set to false, or
if it is set to true and you make additional startSession() calls, those session starts will be associated with the current
activity at the time of the call. It is important that for each startSession() call in an activity that there be a matching
endSession() call in that activity, otherwise session reports may not be sent correctly to Flurry. If you do not want to
manage startSession() and endSession() calls manually on Android, it is recommended that you set this property to true.
Defaults to false.</p>
<h2>Session Functions</h2>
<h3>startSession(string apiKey)  (alias: onStartSession)</h3>
<p>Starts your Flurry session. You must the Flurry apiKey for your application. Usually iOS and Android applications are
configured separately in Flurry, so you may want to make this property configurable, depending on the platform.</p>
<h3>endSession()  (alias: onEndSession)</h3>
<p>(Android only) Explicitly specifies the end of a session on Android. Application close and pause events can be tracked
automatically on iOS (see the <code>sessionReportsOnCloseEnabled</code> and <code>sessionReportsOnPauseEnabled</code> properties) however this
is not supported on Android. If you have a point in your application where you want to explicitly specify an end to the
tracking session, you may call this function. This method has no effect when called on iOS.</p>
<h2>Event and Error Logging Functions</h2>
<h3>logEvent(string event[, dictionary parameters])</h3>
<p>Logs a custom event to Flurry. The first parameter is the event name (can be anything you want) and is required. The
maximum length of an event name is 255 characters. An application can have up to 300 different event types in Flurry. You
can also optionally pass a second argument with a dictionary of parameter names and values (just use a simple Javascript
object). You can use this to send additional data with a particular event, taking care not to expose any sensitive user
information. The parameters object can only contain a maximum of 10 keys. Attempting to send more than 10 keys will
result in the event being logged as if no parameters were sent (i.e. everything is discarded). Both the parameter keys
and values should be serializable.</p>
<h3>logTimedEvent(string event[, dictionary parameters])</h3>
<p>Same as <code>logEvent()</code>, but tracks the beginning of a timed event.</p>
<h3>endTimedEvent(string event[, dictionary properties])</h3>
<p>Use this method to end a timed event that was started with <code>logTimedEvent()</code>. The event name (and any optional parameters)
should match what was used to start the timed event.</p>
<h3>logError(string error, string message)  (alias: onError)</h3>
<p>You can use this method to log when an error occurs in your application. Use the first parameters as an error code/type,
and the second parameter as a custom error message.</p>
<h2>Page View Functions</h2>
<h3>logAllPageViews()</h3>
<p>(iOS only) Enables the Flurry agent to automatically detect and log page views. A page view is defined as traversing a
UINavigationController or UITabBarController. The page view count is only a counter for the number of transitions in your
app. It does not associate a name with the page count. This only needs to be called in your application once.</p>
<h3>pauseBackgroundSession()</h3>
<p>(iOS only) This method is useful when setBackgroundSessionEnabled is set to true. It can be called when your application
has finished all background tasks (such as playing music) to pause session. If the app is resumed before time specified in
setSessionContinueSeconds, the session will continue, otherwise a new session will begin.</p>
<h3>logPageView()</h3>
<p>Used to manually log a page view, typically some kind of transition in your application.</p>
<h2>User Info Functions</h2>
<h3>setUserId(string userId)  (alias: setUserID)</h3>
<p>Use this to log an identifying id or username for a user, as defined by your application.</p>
<h3>setAge(int age)</h3>
<p>Use this to log the age of a user. Valid values are 0 or greater.</p>
<h3>setGender(string gender)</h3>
<p>Use this to log the gender of a user. Valid values are 'm' for male and 'f' for female.</p>
<h2>Location Reporting Functions</h2>
<h3>recordLocation(dictionary parameters)</h3>
<p>(iOS only) This allows you to record the current location of a user. Flurry only keeps track of the last location specified
per session. Regardless of accuracy specified, the Flurry SDK will only report location at city level or higher. Location
is aggregated across all users of your app and not available on a per user basis.
CAUTION: If your app does not use location services in a meaningful way, accessing the user's location may result in your
app submission to the Apple App Store being rejected. Only use this method if you are already using location services for
some other purpose (i.e. do not enable location services just for tracking in Flurry).</p>
<p>The dictionary parameters object should contain the following keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>float latitude</li>
<li>float longitude</li>
<li>float horizontalAccuracy</li>
<li>float verticalAccuracy</li>
</ul>
